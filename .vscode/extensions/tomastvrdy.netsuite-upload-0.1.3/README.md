## Setup
##### NetSuite setup
- Upload `netSuiteRestlet/vscodeExtensionRestlet.js` file somewhere in the `SuiteScripts` folder in NetSuite
- Create and deploy RESTlet using the file. (RESTlet URL will be set in the `settings.json`)

##### VSCode project setup
- Open your local root **SuiteScripts** folder in VSCode
- If not yet created, create one or update the project `settings.json` inside the `.vscode` folder
- Copy the following code to `settings.json` and update with your settings

**settings.json**
```javascript
{
	// Authentication header
  	"netSuiteUpload.authentication": "NLAuth nlauth_account=<ACCOUNTID>, nlauth_email=<LOGIN>, nlauth_signature=<PASSWORD>, nlauth_role=<ROLE>",

	// Restlet URL
	"netSuiteUpload.restlet": "<RESTlet URL>",

	// Temporary folder (e.g. C:\\temp) - used for storing compared file
	"netSuiteUpload.tempFolder": "<TEMP FOLDER PATH>"
}
```

## Limitation
The plugin is using RESTlet for the communication with the NetSuite which is having some governance limitation. Current implementation does not deal with this problem, so there could be a problem to pull folders containing a lot of items from NetSuite.
